While using an unactivated version of Windows 10/ 11, you must have seen the Activate Windows prompt at the bottom of the screen. Microsoft uses Windows Activation to prevent software privacy by ensuring that you are using a genuine Windows copy.

Windows Activation makes sure that a particular copy is not running on multiple systems. Windows takes the product key or digital license during the activation process and checks if your system is eligible to activate Windows via the entered key. Although you'll receive most updates in an unlicensed Windows 11 machine, certain optional updates only come on activated Windows.

## What Is Windows Activation and How Does It Work?

Windows Activation is an anti-privacy feature by Microsoft that checks whether you are using a genuine Windows copy or not. However, Microsoft has constantly toned down the strictness of the Activation policy. Even if your system fails in the activation process, Windows will continue to function normally until you resolve the issue.

## Different Methods to Activate Windows

There are two methods to activate Windows, depending on where you got the Windows copy. The first method requires you to have a 25-character product key. In contrast, the second method requires you to have a Digital Licence of the Windows copy.

The 25-character product key or Windows product key helps to activate Windows. The product key will look something like this - XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX. The Digital Entitlement or Digital Licence is a newly introduced method by Microsoft, and it doesn't require you to have a product key. Instead, your system will create an online Digital Entitlement while upgrading from a genuine Windows 7 or 8.1 copy to the latest Windows 11/10 version via the internet. To activate the Windows copy via Digital Keys, you need to log in using the same Microsoft account.

There are three ways for Windows Activation--OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), Microsoft Activation servers, and KMS.
